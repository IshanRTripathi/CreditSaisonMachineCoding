 **Host code on GitHub**<br>
 **Host product on EC2 or Heroku (both offer free tiers).**<br>
 **Your code should stand alone include a good readme / any libraries or dependencies
should be codified into configuration and / or be built up using scripts that you provide.**<br>

The coding challenge gives us a chance to review your thought process before we move<br>
forward. Expect questions about it during interviews and expect to discuss design and coding<br>

Backend Challenge<br>
Given the data about Food Trucks in San Francisco : here (https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat) <br>
You will build an API that allows the following operations on this data set<br>
 **Search by name of applicant**<br>
 **Search by expiration date, to find whose permits have expired**<br>
 **Search by street name**<br>
 **Add new food truck entry to the dataset**<br>
 **Given a delivery location, find out the closest truck possible.**<br>

Assumptions:
1. Search by street name functionality => street name is mapped to locationDescription column in the csv
